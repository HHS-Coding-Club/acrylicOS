# acrylicOS

This is acrylicOS, a web based operating system written in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
acrylicOS is written in a way that it can be run on any web server, and can be accessed from any device with a web browser. (Note: acrylicOS is not optimized for mobile devices, and is best viewed on a desktop or laptop computer.)

## System Informations
AcrylicOS runs on a virtual kernel called 'butterfly'. The kernel is written in JavaScript, and is responsible for managing the system's resources and processes. The kernel is loaded into memory when the system is booted, and is responsible for loading the system's applications and libraries.

Acrylic is a multi-user system, and supports multiple user accounts. Each user has their own home directory, and can customize their desktop and settings to their liking.

Acrylic has the following applications pre-installed, and tools:
- Canvas    : Sleek, modern, and customizable web browser.
- Papyrus   : Noteworthy text editor.
- Palette   : Hackable code editor.
- Frame     : Minimalist image viewer.
- Mural     : Quick audio player that supports mp3, ogg, and wav files.
- Atlas     : Flexible file manager.
- Reel      : Simple video player that supports mp4 and webm files.
- Studio    : Acrylic's built-in Terminal Emulator.
- Hue       : System settings and customization tool.

## Installation

You can install acrylicOS on your web server by downloading the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/hhs-coding-club/acrylicOS), or you can clone the repository and run it locally on your computer.

acrylicOS doesn't require any server-side dependencies, and can be run on any web server that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which is pretty much every web server.

## Apples

Apples is the programming language used to write applications for acrylicOS. Apples is a simple, easy-to-learn language that is designed to be accessible to beginners, while still being powerful enough for experienced developers.

If you don't know how to program in Apples, don't worry! acrylicOS also supports JavaScript, so you can write applications in JavaScript if you prefer.

If you want to learn more about Apples, you can visit (or contribute!) the [Apples repository](https://github.com/hhs-coding-club/apples).
